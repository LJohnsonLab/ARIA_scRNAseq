    "text": "3.1.1 Inflection Plots\nInflection plots are diagnostic tools used in droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq to distinguish real cells from empty droplets or background ambient RNA. They help identify a threshold between barcodes corresponding to real cells and those that are likely empty droplets or background noise.\n\n\nWhat is an inflection plot?\n\nAn inflection plot usually shows:\n\nThe barcode rank (x-axis, in decreasing order of total UMI counts per barcode)\nThe total UMI count per barcode (y-axis)\n\nBarcodes are ranked from highest to lowest UMI count. The shape of the curve is typically steep initially (real cells with high counts) and then flattens out (empty droplets or noise).\nKey regions in the plot:\n\nLeft (steep drop): Real cells with high transcript counts.\nInflection point / knee: A natural drop in total UMI count. This point is used to define a threshold between real cells and background.\nRight (flat tail): Low UMI barcodes, likely empty droplets or ambient RNA.\n\nHow it’s used:\n\nEmpty droplets: Barcodes after the knee point usually correspond to droplets that did not capture a cell, containing only ambient RNA.\nBackground/ambient RNA: These droplets have very low transcript counts and a high mitochondrial content.\nMultiplets (doublets/triplets): These tend to lie before the inflection point, but with abnormally high counts. They’re not detected by the plot directly, but if a barcode has too many UMIs or genes, it may be flagged as a possible doublet. These are detected better with dedicated tools like DoubletFinder or Scrublet.\n\n\n\ninflections &lt;- CalculateBarcodeInflections(seurat_merged)\nBarcodeInflectionsPlot(inflections) +\n  scale_x_continuous(trans = \"log10\") +\n  scale_color_viridis_d()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 QC metrics\nSeurat allows you to easily explore QC metrics and filter cells based on any user-defined criteria. A few QC metrics commonly used by the community (Ilicic et al. 2016) include:\n\nThe number of unique genes detected in each cell.\n\nLow-quality cells or empty droplets will often have very few genes\nCell doublets or multiplets may exhibit an aberrantly high gene count\n\nSimilarly, the total number of molecules detected within a cell (correlates strongly with unique genes)\nThe percentage of reads that map to the mitochondrial genome\n\nLow-quality / dying cells often exhibit extensive mitochondrial contamination\nWe calculate mitochondrial QC metrics with the PercentageFeatureSet() function, which calculates the percentage of counts originating from a set of features\nWe use the set of all genes starting with MT- as a set of mitochondrial genes\n\n\n\nseurat_merged[[\"percent_mito\"]] &lt;- PercentageFeatureSet(seurat_merged, pattern = \"^mt\")\nseurat_merged[[\"percent_ribo\"]] &lt;- PercentageFeatureSet(seurat_merged, pattern = \"^Rp[ls]\")\nseurat_merged[[\"percent_hemoglobin\"]] &lt;- PercentageFeatureSet(seurat_merged, pattern = \"^Hb[^PES]\")\nseurat_merged[[\"percent_plat\"]] &lt;- PercentageFeatureSet(seurat_merged,pattern = \"Pecam1|Pf4\")\n\n\n\nmd &lt;- c(\"percent_mito\", \"percent_ribo\",\"percent_hemoglobin\", \"percent_plat\", \"Malat1\" )\n\nVlnPlot(seurat_merged, assay = \"RNA\", log = F,\n        group.by = \"orig.ident\", features = md, pt.size = 0.1,alpha = 0.01, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Most expressed genes in the dataset\n\n# Compute the proportion of counts of each gene per cell\n# Use sparse matrix operations, if your dataset is large, doing matrix devisions the regular way will take a very long time.\n\nC &lt;- seurat_merged[[\"RNA\"]]$counts\nC@x &lt;- C@x / rep.int(colSums(C), diff(C@p)) * 100\nmost_expressed &lt;- order(Matrix::rowSums(C), decreasing = T)[20:1]\nboxplot(as.matrix(t(C[most_expressed, ])),\n    cex = 0.1, las = 1, xlab = \"Percent counts per cell\",\n    col = (scales::hue_pal())(20)[20:1], horizontal = TRUE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 SCTransform on the merged Seurat object for QC.\n\n# Normalize with SCTransform (regress out unwanted sources of variation if needed)\nseurat_merged &lt;- SCTransform(seurat_merged)\n\n# Run PCA\nseurat_merged &lt;- RunPCA(seurat_merged)\n\n# Run UMAP\nseurat_merged &lt;- RunUMAP(seurat_merged, dims = 1:20)\n\nsave (seurat_merged, file = \"data/20250620-Seurat_merged.Rdata\")\n\n\n# visualize UMAP\n\nload(\"data/20250620-Seurat_merged.Rdata\")\nFeaturePlot(seurat_merged, features = c(\"percent_ribo\",\"percent_mito\", \"nFeature_RNA\",\"Malat1\"), \n            split.by = \"type\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the UMAP, regions with low nFeature_RNA (low gene detection per cell) tend to overlap with areas of high percent.ribo, indicating that cells with poor transcript diversity are enriched in ribosomal RNA, a typical marker of low-quality or dying cells. These same areas also show low expression of Malat1, a gene commonly used as a proxy for cell quality in scRNAseq data (Clarke and Bader 2024; Montserrat-Ayuso and Esteve-Codina 2024), further supporting that these clusters may represent transcriptionally inactive or degraded cells. The convergence of these three features, as shown in the correlation plot below, suggests that these regions likely contain “damaged” cells that should be considered for filtering during quality control.\n\n#| layout-ncol: 2\n#| fig-width:10\n#| column: page\n\nMalat1 &lt;-LayerData(seurat_merged, layer = \"scale.data\", assay = \"SCT\")[\"Malat1\", ]\n\nmat &lt;- bind_cols(seurat_merged[[\"percent_mito\"]], seurat_merged[[\"percent_ribo\"]], seurat_merged[[\"percent_hemoglobin\"]], seurat_merged[[\"percent_plat\"]], Malat1 = Malat1, seurat_merged[[\"nFeature_RNA\"]]) \n\ncorr_mat &lt;- cor(mat, method = \"p\")\ncorrplot(corr_mat,\n         title = \"Correlation plot\", type = \"upper\")",

Both cells and features are ordered according to their PCA scores. Setting cells to a number plots the ‘extreme’ cells on both ends of the spectrum, which dramatically speeds plotting for large datasets. Though clearly a supervised analysis, we find this to be a valuable tool for exploring correlated feature sets.\nDimHeatmap() can support PCA selection, but it’s not a standalone method for choosing the number of significant PCs. It helps you understand what each PC is capturing biologically.\n\n\nHow to use DimHeatmap() for PC selection\n\n\nExplore PCs one by one:\nLook for clear expression patterns: Meaningful PCs will show:\n\nGroups of genes that vary together\nBlocks of cells with high vs low expression\nExpression patterns that correspond to known cell states or subtypes\n\nIgnore PCs with noisy or random patterns: PCs that do not separate cells meaningfully (random or uniform expression) likely represent noise or technical variation.\nCombine with ElbowPlot: Use ElbowPlot() to identify where the variance explained starts to level off, then validate the top PCs by checking if DimHeatmap() shows biologically meaningful gene patterns.\n\n\n\nDimHeatmap(seurat_integrated, dims = 1:20, cells = 500, balanced = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo overcome the extensive technical noise in any single feature for scRNA-seq data, Seurat clusters cells based on their PCA scores, with each PC essentially representing a ‘metafeature’ that combines information across a correlated feature set. The top principal components therefore represent a robust compression of the dataset. However, how many components should we choose to include? 10? 20? 100?\nIn Macosko et al, we implemented a resampling test inspired by the JackStraw procedure. While still available in Seurat (see previous vignette), this is a slow and computationally expensive procedure, and we is no longer routinely used in single cell analysis.\nAn alternative heuristic method generates an ‘Elbow plot’: a ranking of principle components based on the percentage of variance explained by each one (ElbowPlot() function). In this example, we can observe an ‘elbow’ around PC14-18.\n\n# Generate an elbow plot to help choose the number of significant principal components\n# The \"elbow\" indicates where the added value of extra PCs begins to diminish\nElbowPlot(seurat_integrated, ndims = 50)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3 KNN\n\n# Construct a K-nearest neighbors graph based on the first 25 PCs\n# This graph is used for downstream clustering\nseurat_integrated &lt;- FindNeighbors(seurat_integrated, dims = 1:25)\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Construct the shared nearest neighbor (SNN) graph\n\n# Perform graph-based clustering to identify cell groups\n# Resolution parameter (default) controls cluster granularity\nseurat_integrated &lt;- FindClusters(seurat_integrated)\n\nModularity Optimizer version 1.3.0 by Ludo Waltman and Nees Jan van Eck\n\nNumber of nodes: 52788\nNumber of edges: 1788354\n\nRunning Louvain algorithm...\nMaximum modularity in 10 random starts: 0.9067\nNumber of communities: 31\nElapsed time: 6 seconds\n\n\n\n\n5.2.5 UMAP embeddings\n\n# Compute a 2D UMAP embedding using the first 20 PCs\n# This provides a visual representation of the data structure\nseurat_integrated &lt;- RunUMAP(seurat_integrated, dims = 1:20, verbose = FALSE)\n\n\n# Visualize the UMAP embedding with clusters labeled\n# Each point is a cell, colored by cluster\nd1 &lt;- DimPlot(seurat_integrated, label = TRUE, repel = T) + theme(legend.position = \"none\") \nd2 &lt;- DimPlot(seurat_integrated, group.by = \"orig.ident\", label = F, alpha = 0.5) + ggtitle(\"\")\nd1|d2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na1 &lt;- VlnPlot(seurat_integrated,features = \"Cx3cr1\", alpha = 0.6)+ theme(legend.position = \"none\")\na2 &lt;- FeaturePlot(seurat_integrated, min.cutoff = \"q10\",features = \"Cx3cr1\")\na1+a2+plot_layout(widths = c(3.5,2), ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsaveRDS(seurat_integrated, file = \"data/20250620-seurat_integrated_UMAP_nFeat&gt;600.Rds\")",

    "text": "7.1 UMAP\nScType is a computational method for automated selection of marker genes based merely on scRNA-seq data (Ianevski, Giri, and Aittokallio 2022). ScType combines a large, curated marker gene database with a cell-type specificity scoring system to accurately assign cell identities. The ScType marker database integrates information from CellMarker, PanglaoDB, and manual curation to include 3,980 markers for 194 human cell types and 4,212 markers for 194 mouse cell types, along with both positive and negative markers across 17 tissues per species. The specificity score quantifies how uniquely a gene identifies a cell type within a tissue by considering its presence across multiple cell types, with higher scores reflecting greater specificity. This score is used to weight gene expression during annotation, enhancing the reliability of cell-type assignments.\nIdents(alldata) &lt;- alldata@meta.data$sctype_classification\nDimPlot(alldata, label = TRUE, repel = T) + \n    NoLegend()\nFeaturePlot(alldata, features = c(\"ribo_percent\",\"nFeature_SCT\",\"Malat1\"),\n            split.by = \"type\")\nDimPlot(alldata, label = TRUE, repel = T, split.by = \"orig.ident\",\n        alpha = 0.5, ncol = 3) +\n    NoLegend()\nDimPlot(alldata, label = TRUE, repel = T, split.by = \"type\",\n        alpha = 0.5) +\n    NoLegend()",

However, when examining the top marker genes obtained from FindAllMarkers, there are no ribosomal genes among the most discriminative features. This suggests that while ribosomal content varies, it does not directly drive cluster identity at the transcriptional marker level.\nPossible cell populations present:\n* Cluster 10: T lymphocytes.\n* Cluster 11: OPCs?\n* Cluster 13: Pericytes/ Neurons ?\n* Cluster 12 ???\n* Cluster 9: Interferon-activated microglia ??\n\nAll those cluster appear in both treatment groups:\n\nDimPlot(microglia, label = TRUE, repel = T, split.by = \"type\") + \n    NoLegend()",
