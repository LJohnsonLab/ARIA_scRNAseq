    "text": "3.1.1 Inflection Plots\nInflection plots are diagnostic tools used in droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq to distinguish real cells from empty droplets or background ambient RNA. They help identify a threshold between barcodes corresponding to real cells and those that are likely empty droplets or background noise.\n\n\nWhat is an inflection plot?\n\nAn inflection plot usually shows:\n\nThe barcode rank (x-axis, in decreasing order of total UMI counts per barcode)\nThe total UMI count per barcode (y-axis)\n\nBarcodes are ranked from highest to lowest UMI count. The shape of the curve is typically steep initially (real cells with high counts) and then flattens out (empty droplets or noise).\nKey regions in the plot:\n\nLeft (steep drop): Real cells with high transcript counts.\nInflection point / knee: A natural drop in total UMI count. This point is used to define a threshold between real cells and background.\nRight (flat tail): Low UMI barcodes, likely empty droplets or ambient RNA.\n\nHow it’s used:\n\nEmpty droplets: Barcodes after the knee point usually correspond to droplets that did not capture a cell, containing only ambient RNA.\nBackground/ambient RNA: These droplets have very low transcript counts and a high mitochondrial content.\nMultiplets (doublets/triplets): These tend to lie before the inflection point, but with abnormally high counts. They’re not detected by the plot directly, but if a barcode has too many UMIs or genes, it may be flagged as a possible doublet. These are detected better with dedicated tools like DoubletFinder or Scrublet.\n\n\n\ninflections &lt;- CalculateBarcodeInflections(seurat_merged)\nBarcodeInflectionsPlot(inflections) +\n  scale_x_continuous(trans = \"log10\") +\n  scale_color_viridis_d()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 QC metrics\nSeurat allows you to easily explore QC metrics and filter cells based on any user-defined criteria. A few QC metrics commonly used by the community (Ilicic et al. 2016) include:\n\nThe number of unique genes detected in each cell.\n\nLow-quality cells or empty droplets will often have very few genes\nCell doublets or multiplets may exhibit an aberrantly high gene count\n\nSimilarly, the total number of molecules detected within a cell (correlates strongly with unique genes)\nThe percentage of reads that map to the mitochondrial genome\n\nLow-quality / dying cells often exhibit extensive mitochondrial contamination\nWe calculate mitochondrial QC metrics with the PercentageFeatureSet() function, which calculates the percentage of counts originating from a set of features\nWe use the set of all genes starting with MT- as a set of mitochondrial genes\n\n\n\nseurat_merged[[\"percent_mito\"]] &lt;- PercentageFeatureSet(seurat_merged, pattern = \"^mt\")\nseurat_merged[[\"percent_ribo\"]] &lt;- PercentageFeatureSet(seurat_merged, pattern = \"^Rp[ls]\")\nseurat_merged[[\"percent_hemoglobin\"]] &lt;- PercentageFeatureSet(seurat_merged, pattern = \"^Hb[^PES]\")\nseurat_merged[[\"percent_plat\"]] &lt;- PercentageFeatureSet(seurat_merged,pattern = \"Pecam1|Pf4\")\n\n\n\nmd &lt;- c(\"percent_mito\", \"percent_ribo\",\"percent_hemoglobin\", \"percent_plat\", \"Malat1\" )\n\nVlnPlot(seurat_merged, assay = \"RNA\", log = F,\n        group.by = \"orig.ident\", features = md, pt.size = 0.1,alpha = 0.01, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Most expressed genes in the dataset\n\n# Compute the proportion of counts of each gene per cell\n# Use sparse matrix operations, if your dataset is large, doing matrix devisions the regular way will take a very long time.\n\nC &lt;- seurat_merged[[\"RNA\"]]$counts\nC@x &lt;- C@x / rep.int(colSums(C), diff(C@p)) * 100\nmost_expressed &lt;- order(Matrix::rowSums(C), decreasing = T)[20:1]\nboxplot(as.matrix(t(C[most_expressed, ])),\n    cex = 0.1, las = 1, xlab = \"Percent counts per cell\",\n    col = (scales::hue_pal())(20)[20:1], horizontal = TRUE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 SCTransform on the merged Seurat object for QC.\n\n# Normalize with SCTransform (regress out unwanted sources of variation if needed)\nseurat_merged &lt;- SCTransform(seurat_merged)\n\n# Run PCA\nseurat_merged &lt;- RunPCA(seurat_merged)\n\n# Run UMAP\nseurat_merged &lt;- RunUMAP(seurat_merged, dims = 1:20)\n\nsave (seurat_merged, file = \"data/20250620-Seurat_merged.Rdata\")\n\n\n# visualize UMAP\n\nload(\"data/20250620-Seurat_merged.Rdata\")\nFeaturePlot(seurat_merged, features = c(\"percent_ribo\",\"percent_mito\", \"nFeature_RNA\",\"Malat1\"), \n            split.by = \"type\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the UMAP, regions with low nFeature_RNA (low gene detection per cell) tend to overlap with areas of high percent.ribo, indicating that cells with poor transcript diversity are enriched in ribosomal RNA, a typical marker of low-quality or dying cells. These same areas also show low expression of Malat1, a gene commonly used as a proxy for cell quality in scRNAseq data (Clarke and Bader 2024; Montserrat-Ayuso and Esteve-Codina 2024), further supporting that these clusters may represent transcriptionally inactive or degraded cells. The convergence of these three features, as shown in the correlation plot below, suggests that these regions likely contain “damaged” cells that should be considered for filtering during quality control.\n\n#| layout-ncol: 2\n#| fig-width:10\n#| column: page\n\nMalat1 &lt;-LayerData(seurat_merged, layer = \"scale.data\", assay = \"SCT\")[\"Malat1\", ]\n\nmat &lt;- bind_cols(seurat_merged[[\"percent_mito\"]], seurat_merged[[\"percent_ribo\"]], seurat_merged[[\"percent_hemoglobin\"]], seurat_merged[[\"percent_plat\"]], Malat1 = Malat1, seurat_merged[[\"nFeature_RNA\"]]) \n\ncorr_mat &lt;- cor(mat, method = \"p\")\ncorrplot(corr_mat,\n         title = \"Correlation plot\", type = \"upper\")",

Both cells and features are ordered according to their PCA scores. Setting cells to a number plots the ‘extreme’ cells on both ends of the spectrum, which dramatically speeds plotting for large datasets. Though clearly a supervised analysis, we find this to be a valuable tool for exploring correlated feature sets.\nDimHeatmap() can support PCA selection, but it’s not a standalone method for choosing the number of significant PCs. It helps you understand what each PC is capturing biologically.\n\n\nHow to use DimHeatmap() for PC selection\n\n\nExplore PCs one by one:\nLook for clear expression patterns: Meaningful PCs will show:\n\nGroups of genes that vary together\nBlocks of cells with high vs low expression\nExpression patterns that correspond to known cell states or subtypes\n\nIgnore PCs with noisy or random patterns: PCs that do not separate cells meaningfully (random or uniform expression) likely represent noise or technical variation.\nCombine with ElbowPlot: Use ElbowPlot() to identify where the variance explained starts to level off, then validate the top PCs by checking if DimHeatmap() shows biologically meaningful gene patterns.\n\n\n\nDimHeatmap(seurat_integrated, dims = 1:20, cells = 500, balanced = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo overcome the extensive technical noise in any single feature for scRNA-seq data, Seurat clusters cells based on their PCA scores, with each PC essentially representing a ‘metafeature’ that combines information across a correlated feature set. The top principal components therefore represent a robust compression of the dataset. However, how many components should we choose to include? 10? 20? 100?\nIn Macosko et al, we implemented a resampling test inspired by the JackStraw procedure. While still available in Seurat (see previous vignette), this is a slow and computationally expensive procedure, and we is no longer routinely used in single cell analysis.\nAn alternative heuristic method generates an ‘Elbow plot’: a ranking of principle components based on the percentage of variance explained by each one (ElbowPlot() function). In this example, we can observe an ‘elbow’ around PC14-18.\n\n# Generate an elbow plot to help choose the number of significant principal components\n# The \"elbow\" indicates where the added value of extra PCs begins to diminish\nElbowPlot(seurat_integrated, ndims = 50)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3 KNN\n\n# Construct a K-nearest neighbors graph based on the first 25 PCs\n# This graph is used for downstream clustering\nseurat_integrated &lt;- FindNeighbors(seurat_integrated, dims = 1:25)\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Construct the shared nearest neighbor (SNN) graph\n\n# Perform graph-based clustering to identify cell groups\n# Resolution parameter (default) controls cluster granularity\nseurat_integrated &lt;- FindClusters(seurat_integrated)\n\nModularity Optimizer version 1.3.0 by Ludo Waltman and Nees Jan van Eck\n\nNumber of nodes: 52788\nNumber of edges: 1788354\n\nRunning Louvain algorithm...\nMaximum modularity in 10 random starts: 0.9067\nNumber of communities: 31\nElapsed time: 6 seconds\n\n\n\n\n5.2.5 UMAP embeddings\n\n# Compute a 2D UMAP embedding using the first 20 PCs\n# This provides a visual representation of the data structure\nseurat_integrated &lt;- RunUMAP(seurat_integrated, dims = 1:20, verbose = FALSE)\n\n\n# Visualize the UMAP embedding with clusters labeled\n# Each point is a cell, colored by cluster\nd1 &lt;- DimPlot(seurat_integrated, label = TRUE, repel = T) + theme(legend.position = \"none\") \nd2 &lt;- DimPlot(seurat_integrated, group.by = \"orig.ident\", label = F, alpha = 0.5) + ggtitle(\"\")\nd1|d2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na1 &lt;- VlnPlot(seurat_integrated,features = \"Cx3cr1\", alpha = 0.6)+ theme(legend.position = \"none\")\na2 &lt;- FeaturePlot(seurat_integrated, min.cutoff = \"q10\",features = \"Cx3cr1\")\na1+a2+plot_layout(widths = c(3.5,2), ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsaveRDS(seurat_integrated, file = \"data/20250620-seurat_integrated_UMAP_nFeat&gt;600.Rds\")",

ScType combines a large, curated marker gene database with a cell-type specificity scoring system to accurately assign cell identities. The ScType marker database integrates information from CellMarker, PanglaoDB, and manual curation to include 3,980 markers for 194 human cell types and 4,212 markers for 194 mouse cell types, along with both positive and negative markers across 17 tissues per species. The specificity score quantifies how uniquely a gene identifies a cell type within a tissue by considering its presence across multiple cell types, with higher scores reflecting greater specificity.

    "text": "8.1 Reclustered microglia\nThe integrated scRNAseq dataset of all brain cell populations was subsetted to retain only cells annotated as microglia by the “expert committee”. The subset was reprocessed using the assay integrated to ensure batch-corrected expression values were used for downstream clustering.\nDimensionality reduction was performed by principal component analysis (PCA) on the set of variable features. An elbow plot was generated to identify the inflection point, and the first 10 principal components were selected for neighborhood graph construction.\nNearest neighbors in the reduced space were computed and an unsupervised clustering across a range of resolutions (0.1 to 1.0, step 0.2) was performed. Cluster stability across resolutions was evaluated with the clustree package, and a resolution of 0.3 was selected as a balance between capturing subpopulation diversity and avoiding overfragmentation.\nThe final clusters were visualized using UMAP. The reclustering identified seven transcriptionally distinct microglial subpopulations (clusters 0–6) (Fig. 1B), compared with the initial single microglia cluster in the whole-brain dataset (Fig. 1A). These clusters exhibited clear separation in UMAP space, indicating distinct transcriptional programs.\nContribution of each original cluster (0-28) towards the reclustered clusters (0-6)\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n5\n8\n12\n13\n14\n28\n\n\n\n\n0\n6007\n146\n101\n95\n0\n189\n14\n0\n3\n45\n\n\n1\n25\n4829\n1\n283\n40\n101\n42\n795\n6\n3\n\n\n2\n196\n121\n4783\n3\n78\n45\n41\n0\n3\n65\n\n\n3\n47\n31\n1\n3337\n7\n2\n709\n15\n11\n15\n\n\n4\n0\n13\n8\n1\n3397\n0\n0\n188\n6\n1\n\n\n5\n603\n18\n14\n17\n1\n2144\n527\n18\n3\n8\n\n\n6\n14\n83\n3\n1\n25\n0\n6\n1\n944\n4",

Upset chart\nThe UpSet chart visualizes the overlaps in marker genes between the different Seurat clusters identified by FindAllMarkers (~Venn diagram for many sets).\n\nHorizontal bars on the left show the total number of unique marker genes for each individual cluster.\nVertical bars at the top quantify the size of each intersection—that is, how many genes are shared by the specific combination of clusters highlighted by the connected black dots below.\nSingle black dots (no connecting lines) indicate marker genes unique to a single cluster.\nMultiple connected dots indicate sets of clusters that share the same marker genes; the connecting lines trace which clusters are part of the intersection.\nA taller vertical bar means a larger number of genes are shared in that

Several chemokines (Ccl3, Ccl4) and receptors (Ccrl2) point to immune cell recruitment, while NF-κB pathway components (Nfkbia, Nfkbiz, Tnfaip3) highlight central inflammatory signaling.

Notably, transcription factors (Rel, Jun, Cebpb) and RNA regulators (Zfp36, Zfp36l1) are decreased, suggesting reduced inflammatory transcription and mRNA turnover. A few genes (Baiap2l2, Tmem163, Serpine2) are upregulated, hinting at selective morphological remodeling and extracellular matrix modulation. Overall, the profile suggests a shift toward a less inflammatory, potentially partially remodeling/reactive microglial state.\n\n\n8.3.3 Cluster 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGene\nCell\nSubtype\nRegulation\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nCtsb\nMicroglia\nLysosomal/phagocytic (DAM-like)\nDownregulated\nCathepsin B; reduced levels suggest diminished phagolysosomal activity typical of DAM/phagocytic programs.\n\n\nSerpine2\nMicroglia\nRemodeling/reactive\nDownregulated\nECM serine protease inhibitor; decrease implies less extracellular remodeling.\n\n\nTgm2\nMicroglia\nActivated/reactive microglia\nUpregulated\nTransglutaminase 2; induced in activated microglia, supports adhesion/phagocytosis and Aβ handling.\n\n\nCacnb2\nMicroglia\nReactive signaling microglia\nUpregulated\nCa²⁺ channel β subunit; heightened Ca²⁺ signaling aligns with reactive state transitions.\n\n\nKlf2\nMicroglia\nHomeostatic/anti‑inflammatory\nUpregulated\nTranscription factor that restrains inflammatory programs; rise suggests homeostatic pushback.\n\n\nIl1a\nMicroglia\nActivated/inflammatory microglia (AIM)\nUpregulated\nPro‑inflammatory cytokine driving local neuroinflammation.\n\n\nSocs3\nMicroglia\nActivated (JAK/STAT feedback)\nUpregulated\nNegative feedback regulator of cytokine signaling; elevation marks acute activation with braking.\n\n\nTmem119\nMicroglia\nHomeostatic microglia\nUpregulated\nCore microglial identity marker; increase indicates preserved homeostatic signature.\n\n\nTrem2\nMicroglia\nDAM/phagocytic\nDownregulated\nKey receptor for DAM induction and lipid/Aβ phagocytosis; drop argues against DAM engagement.\n\n\nCd68\nMicroglia\nPhagocytic/activated\nDownregulated\nLysosomal/phagolysosomal marker; reduction indicates lower phagocytic tone.\n\n\nSyngr1\nMicroglia\nContamination/neuronal signal\nDownregulated\nSynaptic vesicle protein (neuronal); decreased expression fits reduced ambient neuronal RNA.\n\n\nFos\nMicroglia\nImmediate‑early gene (IEG)‑activated\nUpregulated\nClassic IEG; marks acute transcriptional activation.\n\n\nCcr5\nMicroglia\nChemotactic/inflammatory\nUpregulated\nChemokine receptor; suggests migration/recruitment during inflammatory response.\n\n\nCrybb1\nMicroglia\nStress‑responsive/reactive\nUpregulated\nCrystallin family chaperone; induced under cellular stress in glia.\n\n\nNr4a1\nMicroglia\nIEG/anti‑inflammatory reprogramming\nUpregulated\nNuclear receptor shaping rapid activation and tolerance programs.\n\n\nJun\nMicroglia\nIEG‑activated\nUpregulated\nAP‑1 component; hallmark of acute stimulus response.\n\n\nRapgef5\nMicroglia\nMotility/chemotaxis signaling\nUpregulated\nRap1 GEF; supports cytoskeletal dynamics and process motility in reactive microglia.\n\n\nCtsd\nMicroglia\nLysosomal/phagocytic (DAM-like)\nDownregulated\nCathepsin D; decrease reinforces reduced lysosomal/phagocytic program.\n\n\nJund\nMicroglia\nIEG‑activated\nUpregulated\nAP‑1 family factor; marks early activation.\n\n\nRnf19b\nMicroglia\nStress/adaptive (proteostasis)\nUpregulated\nE3 ubiquitin ligase (ERAD/quality control); elevation indicates proteostatic stress response.\n\n\n\nCluster 2 combines strong IEG/cytokine activation (Fos/Jun/Jund, Il1a, Socs3, Ccr5) with preservation of homeostatic identity (Tmem119, Klf2↑) and suppression of DAM/phagolysosomal genes (Trem2, Cd68, Ctsb, Ctsd↓). This pattern supports an acute, non‑phagocytic inflammatory microglial state with chemotactic/migratory bias and active negative‑feedback (Socs3), rather than a classic Trem2⁺ DAM phenotype. Tgm2 and stress markers (Crybb1, Rnf19b) suggest matrix/adhesion changes and proteostatic adaptation during this transient activation.\n\n\n8.3.4 Cluster 3:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGene\nCell\nSubtype\nRegulation\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nSpp1\nMicroglia\nSpp1⁺ DAM (osteopontin-high)\nUpregulated\nCanonical Spp1⁺ neurodegeneration-associated subset; linked to phagolysosomal activation and plaque-proximal microglia.\n\n\nAtp6v0d2\nMicroglia\nSpp1⁺ DAM\nUpregulated\nLysosomal/osteoclast-like proton pump subunit enriched in Spp1⁺ DAM; supports catabolic/phagolysosomal programs.\n\n\nH2-Aa\nMicroglia\nMHC-II⁺ antigen-presenting microglia (ARM)\nUpregulated\nMHC-II component indicating antigen presentation.\n\n\nGpnmb\nMicroglia\nDAM/MGnD\nUpregulated\nInjury/DAM marker enriched in neurodegenerative microglia and lipid-handling states.\n\n\nH2-Eb1\nMicroglia\nMHC-II⁺ ARM\nUpregulated\nMHC-II beta-chain; antigen presentation program.\n\n\nItgax\nMicroglia\nDAM/MGnD (CD11c⁺)\nUpregulated\nCD11c⁺ “activated”/MGnD microglia; plaque-associated.\n\n\nFabp5\nMicroglia\nLipid-handling DAM / LDAM-like\nUpregulated\nFatty-acid–binding protein; lipid metabolism and phagocytosis in activated microglia.\n\n\nDkk2\nMicroglia\nNeurodegenerative-DAM subset\nUpregulated\nWnt antagonist selectively induced in mouse neurodegenerative microglia near plaques.\n\n\nTrpc4\nMicroglia\nActivated/DAM-associated\nUpregulated\nCa²⁺ channel up in activated microglia; supports motility/chemotaxis in DAM contexts.\n\n\nH2-Ab1\nMicroglia\nMHC-II⁺ ARM\nUpregulated\nMHC-II alpha-chain; part of antigen-presenting signature.\n\n\nCtnna3\nMicroglia\nActivated/DAM-associated\nUpregulated\nCell-adhesion gene reported in activated/DAM-like microglia; may reflect contact with dystrophic neurites.\n\n\nSiglech\nMicroglia\nHomeostatic\nDownregulated\nHomeostatic microglia marker; its loss marks transition to non-homeostatic/DAM states.\n\n\nP2ry12\nMicroglia\nHomeostatic\nDownregulated\nCore homeostatic microglia receptor; down in activated/DAM microglia.\n\n\nCst7\nMicroglia\nDAM/MGnD\nUpregulated\nCathepsin inhibitor robustly induced in DAM; linked to lysosomal remodeling.\n\n\nIgf1\nMicroglia\nIGF1⁺ reparative microglia\nUpregulated\nTrophic/reparative program; promotes oligodendrocyte/myelin support within disease context.\n\n\nPlau\nMicroglia\nActivated ECM-remodeling/DAM\nUpregulated\nuPA; extracellular matrix remodeling and migration; increased in activated plaque-associated microglia.\n\n\nCd74\nMicroglia\nMHC-II⁺ ARM\nUpregulated\nInvariant chain for MHC-II; hallmark of antigen-presenting microglia.\n\n\nMamdc2\nMicroglia\nActivated/DAM-associated\nUpregulated\nExtracellular/adhesion protein reported in activated plaque-proximal microglia subsets.\n\n\nLpcat2\nMicroglia\nPro‑inflammatory eicosanoid program\nDownregulated\nArachidonoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase; lower levels suggest shift away from classical lipid‑inflammatory signaling.\n\n\nLgals3\nMicroglia\nActivated/DAM (Galectin‑3⁺)\nUpregulated\nGalectin‑3 drives phagocytosis and TREM2 signaling; strong DAM/plaqued‑associated marker.\n\n\n\nMost markers map to disease-associated microglia (DAM), including a prominent Spp1⁺/osteoclast‑like module (Spp1, Atp6v0d2, Gpnmb, Fabp5, Dkk2, Itgax, Cst7, Lgals3) and an antigen-presenting MHC‑II arm (H2-Aa/H2-Ab1/H2-Eb1, Cd74). Homeostatic signatures (P2ry12, Siglech) are down, consistent with an activated, plaque‑proximal state. Additional genes (Plau, Trpc4, Ctnna3, Mamdc2) support activation/motility and ECM remodeling, while Igf1 suggests a concurrent reparative program.

This suggests a non-DAM reactive state biased toward chemotaxis and cytoskeletal remodeling rather than debris clearance. The pattern could reflect microglia mobilized for migration or vascular surveillance, rather than plaque-engulfment, potentially relevant to vascular and inflammatory components of ARIA where microglial motility and cytokine signaling are heightened while phagocytosis is reduced.\n\n\n8.3.6 Cluster 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGene\nCell\nSubtype\nRegulation\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nItgam\nMicroglia\nDAM/phagocytic\nDownregulated\nEncodes CD11b; key for adhesion and phagocytosis; reduction indicates lowered phagocytic activation.\n\n\nIfi207\nMicroglia\nInterferon-responsive/reactive\nUpregulated\nIFN-inducible gene; upregulation marks antiviral/innate immune activation.\n\n\nC1qb\nMicroglia\nComplement-mediated DAM\nDownregulated\nComplement component; downregulation suggests reduced synaptic pruning and opsonization.\n\n\nCcl4\nMicroglia\nChemotactic/inflammatory\nUpregulated\nPro-inflammatory chemokine; promotes immune cell recruitment to CNS lesions.\n\n\nLilrb4a\nMicroglia\nRegulatory/immune-checkpoint\nUpregulated\nInhibitory receptor; induced in inflammatory contexts to limit activation.\n\n\nLy86\nMicroglia\nInnate immune/TLR signaling\nUpregulated\nMD-1 protein; modulates TLR4/MD-2 signaling in microglial innate immune responses.\n\n\nC1qc\nMicroglia\nComplement-mediated DAM\nDownregulated\nComplement cascade subunit; loss further supports reduced opsonization activity.\n\n\nFgf13\nMicroglia\nReactive/stress-adaptive\nUpregulated\nCytosolic growth factor family member; linked to microtubule stabilization in reactive states.\n\n\nC1qa\nMicroglia\nComplement-mediated DAM\nDownregulated\nInitiator of classical complement pathway; decreased expression suggests suppressed complement activity.\n\n\nKlf6\nMicroglia\nPro-inflammatory transcriptional reprogramming\nUpregulated\nInduced by stress/injury; regulates inflammatory and migratory genes.\n\n\nDusp1\nMicroglia\nAnti-inflammatory/feedback\nUpregulated\nMAPK phosphatase; limits MAPK-driven pro-inflammatory signaling.\n\n\nAtf3\nMicroglia\nImmediate-early gene (IEG)-activated\nUpregulated\nStress-responsive transcription factor; marks acute activation.\n\n\nP2ry12\nMicroglia\nHomeostatic\nDownregulated\nPurinergic receptor; loss is a hallmark of activated, non-homeostatic states.\n\n\nMarcks\nMicroglia\nCytoskeletal/homeostatic\nDownregulated\nMembrane–actin crosslinker; reduced levels impair process motility and membrane dynamics.\n\n\nRgs10\nMicroglia\nHomeostatic/anti-inflammatory\nDownregulated\nRegulator of G-protein signaling; decreased levels permit stronger chemokine receptor signaling.\n\n\nCst3\nMicroglia\nHomeostatic/lysosomal\nDownregulated\nCystatin C; lysosomal protease inhibitor; loss suggests altered proteolytic control.\n\n\nCtss\nMicroglia\nDAM/phagocytic\nDownregulated\nCathepsin S; key for antigen processing and myelin degradation; reduced expression indicates diminished phagolysosomal activity.\n\n\nHexb\nMicroglia\nHomeostatic\nDownregulated\nβ-Hexosaminidase subunit; essential for lysosomal function; decrease reflects impaired lysosomal metabolism.\n\n\nLaptm5\nMicroglia\nLysosomal/immune activation\nDownregulated\nLysosomal membrane protein; reduction suggests suppressed lysosomal activity.\n\n\nXylt1\nMicroglia\nECM remodeling/reactive\nUpregulated\nGlycosyltransferase in proteoglycan biosynthesis; may reflect ECM reorganization during injury response.\n\n\n\nCluster 5 exhibits a marked downregulation of complement components (C1qa/b/c) and multiple lysosomal/phagocytic markers (Itgam, Ctss, Hexb, Laptm5), indicating a suppressed DAM-like phagocytic program. Concurrently, upregulated genes point to a mixed interferon-responsive and inflammatory signaling state (Ifi207, Ccl4, Ly86, Klf6, Atf3) with regulatory feedback mechanisms (Dusp1, Lilrb4a) and ECM remodeling (Xylt1). Loss of homeostatic markers (P2ry12, Marcks, Rgs10, Cst3) reinforces a non-homeostatic activated phenotype, biased toward cytokine production and immune modulation rather than debris clearance.\n\n\n8.3.7 Cluster 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGene\nCell\nSubtype\nRegulation\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nIfit3\nMicroglia\nType I interferon–responsive microglia (IRMs)\nUpregulated\nIFN-induced protein; hallmark of antiviral/innate immune activation in microglia.\n\n\nIfi211\nMicroglia\nIRMs\nUpregulated\nInterferon-inducible family member; part of broad IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) program.\n\n\nIfi206\nMicroglia\nIRMs\nUpregulated\nISG; contributes to innate antiviral defense.\n\n\nIfit2\nMicroglia\nIRMs\nUpregulated\nAntiviral effector limiting viral replication; robustly induced by IFN signaling.\n\n\nRsad2\nMicroglia\nIRMs\nUpregulated\nViperin; antiviral protein regulating lipid metabolism during innate responses.\n\n\nIsg15\nMicroglia\nIRMs\nUpregulated\nUbiquitin-like modifier; critical in IFN-induced protein modification during antiviral states.\n\n\nMx1\nMicroglia\nIRMs\nUpregulated\nDynamin-like GTPase; classical ISG conferring antiviral resistance.\n\n\nIfit3b\nMicroglia\nIRMs\nUpregulated\nParalog of Ifit3; IFN-inducible, part of viral RNA sensing and translation suppression pathway.\n\n\nIfi213\nMicroglia\nIRMs\nUpregulated\nISG with poorly characterized function; linked to innate immunity.\n\n\nOasl2\nMicroglia\nIRMs\nUpregulated\n2′–5′-oligoadenylate synthase–like; antiviral RNA degradation pathway.\n\n\nA330040F15Rik\nMicroglia\nIRMs\nUpregulated\nPredicted IFN-inducible transcript; uncharacterized in function.\n\n\nIfi209\nMicroglia\nIRMs\nUpregulated\nMember of IFN-inducible family; potential nucleic acid sensor.\n\n\nSlfn5\nMicroglia\nIRMs\nUpregulated\nSchlafen family protein; modulates immune responses and cell cycle during activation.\n\n\nGm4951\nMicroglia\nIRMs\nUpregulated\nPredicted IFN-inducible gene; enriched in viral defense transcriptional programs.\n\n\nIfitm3\nMicroglia\nIRMs\nUpregulated\nRestricts viral entry by modifying endosomal membranes.\n\n\nStat1\nMicroglia\nIRMs\nUpregulated\nMaster transcription factor for type I/II IFN responses; drives IRM transcriptional network.\n\n\nIfi207\nMicroglia\nIRMs\nUpregulated\nISG; part of IFN-driven antiviral gene set.\n\n\nRnf213\nMicroglia\nIRMs\nUpregulated\nE3 ligase with roles in immunity and vascular remodeling; induced by IFNs.\n\n\nSp100\nMicroglia\nIRMs\nUpregulated\nNuclear body protein; upregulated in antiviral and inflammatory contexts.\n\n\nHerc6\nMicroglia\nIRMs\nUpregulated\nE3 ligase mediating ISGylation; essential for ISG15 conjugation pathway.\n\n\n\nCluster 6 shows uniform upregulation of type I interferon–stimulated genes (ISGs), including antiviral effectors (Ifit3, Rsad2, Mx1, Ifitm3), nucleic acid sensors (Oasl2, Stat1, Sp100), and ISGylation machinery (Isg15, Herc6). This profile is characteristic of interferon-responsive microglia (IRMs), a distinct activation state often triggered by viral infection, nucleic acid release from damaged cells, or chronic inflammatory cues.
