## Cleaned dataset 

After profound contemplation, the committee of experts decided to eliminate clusters 18, 21, 30, and 31 based on the markers represented in the violin plot.

```{r}
Idents(alldata) <- alldata$seurat_clusters
alldata_clean <- subset(alldata, idents = c(18,21,30,31), invert = T)

```

### UMAP
```{r}

    NoLegend()

Idents(alldata_clean) <- alldata_clean$sctype_classification
d2 <- DimPlot(alldata_clean, label = TRUE, repel = T, label.size = 4,) + 
    NoLegend()

### Marker genes (chatGPT 5)

```{r}
markers <- read_csv("data/20250812-all_markers.csv")
```


For each Seurat cluster, the top differentially expressed genes were selected based on two criteria:  
1. The gene had to be expressed in more than 30% of the cells in the cluster (pct.1 > 0.3), ensuring that selected genes represent markers broadly expressed within the cluster rather than being driven by rare subpopulations.  

2. Among those genes, we ranked by the average log₂ fold change (avg_log2FC) relative to all other clusters and selected the top 20 genes with the highest positive fold change. This favors genes with the most specific and robust upregulation in the cluster of interest.

Most genes point to activated microglia with a pro-inflammatory/DAM profile (NF-κB, TLR, cytokine, lipid-handling, and endolysosomal programs). One clear vascular marker (Pdgfb) indicates endothelial signal. Cd180 suggests a minor B-cell presence. Whrn and Dennd4a are less specific but fit best with neuronal and activated-myeloid contexts, respectively.

Cluster 1 contains a strong microglial signature, with many homeostatic and activated/DAM markers (Ctsz, Hexb, Sirpa, Fcgr3, Gpr183, Marchf3) and a hypoxia-responsive profile (Hif1a, Egln3, P4ha1). Several neuronal genes (Serpine2, Baiap2l2, Adarb1, Immp2l) suggest either mixed-cell contamination or close neuronal interaction. A few genes (Tcap, Tex14, Gm56614, Gm57375) are likely ambient RNA or non-CNS contaminants. Overall, this cluster most likely represents hypoxia-responsive activated microglia with some mixed neuronal signal.

Most genes indicate activated microglia with DAM, phagocytic, lipid-handling, and NF-κB/stress feedback programs. A vascular signal appears via Entpd1. Adrb2 points to astrocytes. Slc8a1 and Chst8 support a minor neuronal component. Overall, cluster 2 aligns best with activated/phagocytic microglia with limited endothelial, astrocytic, and neuronal admixture.

Cluster 4 shows a mixed profile with a strong mature oligodendrocyte signature (Qdpr, Aspa, Abca2, Plekhh1, C030029H02Rik, A230001M10Rik) alongside a substantial set of neuronal markers (Tmem151a, Vldlr, Lrrn1, Jph4, Mast4, Efhd1). This pattern may reflect partial doublets or oligodendrocyte–neuron interactions in myelinated tracts. Uncharacterized predicted genes likely follow the main cell-type patterns observed.

The profile is predominantly endothelial with strong junctional, caveolar, and transport signatures (Rasip1, Ocln, Icam2, Cav2, Hspa12b, Thsd1). Pericyte markers (Rgs12, Maoa) indicate mural cell admixture. Far2 suggests minor oligodendrocyte contamination. Overall, this cluster maps to brain microvascular endothelium with some perivascular support cells.

Most genes map to the oligodendrocyte lineage, mixing OPC markers (Lpar1, Pou3f1) with mature/myelinating programs (Tspan2, Ddr1, Serinc5, Tspan15, Lpgat1, Sox10). Several neuronal structural/vesicle genes (Pak1, Ablim2, Sh3gl3, Tmod1, Aatk, Cerox1) suggest nearby neurons or doublets. Neat1 indicates a glial/astrocytic component. Kit points to rare perivascular mast cells, and Tnni1 likely reflects ambient or non-CNS contamination.

Cluster 13 shows a mixed neuronal–endothelial–microglial profile. Neuronal structural/signaling genes (Fgf13, Cacna1a, Tanc2, Nav2, Sdk1, Wwox, Plcl1) dominate. Endothelial angiogenic/junctional markers (Plxdc2, Nrp1, Arhgap24, Mir99ahg, Mamdc2) suggest strong vascular contribution. Microglial homeostatic and lipid-handling markers (Cx3cr1, Gpr34, Hpgds, Fyb) indicate perivascular or vessel-associated microglia. The composition points to neurovascular interface cells.

Cluster 28 is a pure proliferation/cell-cycle signature, dominated by G2/M phase and mitotic spindle/kinetochore genes (Birc5, Mki67, Top2a, Cenp family, Tpx2, Nusap1). The profile fits actively dividing cells from multiple lineages—likely cycling OPCs, microglia, or endothelial cells—rather than a distinct mature cell type. Ifi27l2a suggests some interferon-responsive cycling cells.

This set shows a dual identity: a strong choroid plexus/ependymal epithelium signature (Folr1, Wfdc2, Kcne2, Spint2, Tmem72, Slc4a5, Fras1, Tmem98) alongside neuronal genes (Otx2os1, Vat1l, Htr2c, Slc4a10, Atp2b3). Endothelial markers (F5, Lbp) suggest vascular contact. Overall, the dominant signal points to choroid plexus epithelial cells, with some neuronal admixture likely from nearby tissue or partial doublets.
