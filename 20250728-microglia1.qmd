```

## Reclustered microglia

The integrated scRNAseq dataset of all brain cell populations was subsetted to retain only cells annotated as microglia by the "expert committee". The subset was reprocessed using the assay `integrated` to ensure batch-corrected expression values were used for downstream clustering.

Dimensionality reduction was performed by principal component analysis (PCA) on the set of variable features. An elbow plot was generated to identify the inflection point, and the first 10 principal components were selected for neighborhood graph construction.

```{r}

# load the previously saved reclustered object (to save time)
load("data/20250913-microglia_reclustered.Rdata")

# Set Seurat cluster IDs as the active identity
Idents(microglia) <- "original_clusters"

# Plot the UMAP of the microglia subset before reclustering
d1 <- DimPlot(microglia, label = TRUE, repel = TRUE, label.size = 5) +
    NoLegend() +
    ggtitle("Subsetted microglia from the\noriginal Seurat object")
```

```{r}
#| eval: false

# Use integrated assay for clustering
DefaultAssay(microglia) <- "integrated"

# Remove old PCA/UMAP/t-SNE reductions to avoid conflicts with re-analysis
microglia@reductions[c("pca","umap","tsne")] <- NULL

# Run PCA on variable features from the integrated assay
microglia <- RunPCA(
  microglia,
  assay   = "integrated",
  features = VariableFeatures(microglia),
  verbose = FALSE
)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(1234)

# Compute nearest neighbors using first 10 PCs
microglia <- FindNeighbors(microglia, reduction = "pca", dims = 1:10)

# Perform clustering at multiple resolutions for later comparison
microglia <- FindClusters(microglia, resolution = seq(0.1, 1.0, 0.2))

# Select the resolution of interest (0.3) and store as "final_clusters"
microglia$final_clusters <- microglia[[paste0("integrated_snn_res.", 0.3)]]
Idents(microglia) <- "final_clusters"

# Compute UMAP for visualization using first 10 PCs
microglia <- RunUMAP(microglia, reduction = "pca", dims = 1:10, verbose = FALSE)

# save(microglia, file = "data/20250913-microglia_reclustered.Rdata")

```

```{r}

# Elbow plot to help decide the number of PCs to retain
ElbowPlot(microglia, ndims = 50) + ggtitle("Elbow Plot")
```

Nearest neighbors in the reduced space were computed and an unsupervised clustering across a range of resolutions (0.1 to 1.0, step 0.2) was performed. Cluster stability across resolutions was evaluated with the `clustree` package, and a resolution of 0.3 was selected as a balance between capturing subpopulation diversity and avoiding overfragmentation.

```{r}
# Visualize cluster stability and relationships across resolutions
clustree(microglia, prefix = "integrated_snn_res.")
```

The final clusters were visualized using UMAP. The reclustering identified seven transcriptionally distinct microglial subpopulations (clusters 0–6) (Fig. 1B), compared with the initial single microglia cluster in the whole-brain dataset (Fig. 1A). These clusters exhibited clear separation in UMAP space, indicating distinct transcriptional programs.

```{r}
#| column: page
#| fig-width: 12

Idents(microglia) <- "final_clusters"

# Plot the reclustered microglia at the chosen resolution
d2 <- DimPlot(microglia, label = TRUE, repel = TRUE, label.size = 6) +
    NoLegend() +
    ggtitle("Reclustered microglia (Resolution: 0.3)")

# Show original subset vs. reclustered side-by-side
d1 | d2
```

```{r}
table(microglia$final_clusters,microglia$original_clusters) |> 
    kbl(caption = "Contribution of each original cluster (0-28) towards the reclustered clusters (0-6)") |> 
    kable_styling("striped")
```

## Cluster markers

Cluster-specific marker genes were determined using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test, restricted to genes expressed in at least 30% of cells within a cluster.  

The table represents the top 20 markers (according to the adjusted p-value) for each cluster:

```{r}
# Identify top marker genes for each cluster
markers_microglia2 <- FindAllMarkers(microglia, min.pct = 0.3,
                                     only.pos = F, densify = TRUE)


mg <- markers_microglia2|> 
    mutate(regulation = ifelse(avg_log2FC<0, "Downregulated","Upregulated")) |> 
    filter(pct.1 > 0.3) |> 
    arrange(cluster, p_val_adj) |> 
    group_by(cluster) |> 
    slice_head(n = 20) |> 
    summarize( top_markers = list(paste0(gene," (",regulation,")")))

# Display results as a striped table

| Rnf19b | Microglia | Stress/adaptive (proteostasis) | Upregulated | E3 ubiquitin ligase (ERAD/quality control); elevation indicates proteostatic stress response. |

Cluster 2 combines strong IEG/cytokine activation (Fos/Jun/Jund, Il1a, Socs3, Ccr5) with preservation of homeostatic identity (Tmem119, Klf2↑) and suppression of DAM/phagolysosomal genes (Trem2, Cd68, Ctsb, Ctsd↓). This pattern supports an acute, non‑phagocytic inflammatory microglial state with chemotactic/migratory bias and active negative‑feedback (Socs3), rather than a classic Trem2⁺ DAM phenotype. Tgm2 and stress markers (Crybb1, Rnf19b) suggest matrix/adhesion changes and proteostatic adaptation during this transient activation.

| Lpcat2 | Microglia | Pro‑inflammatory eicosanoid program | Downregulated | Arachidonoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase; lower levels suggest shift away from classical lipid‑inflammatory signaling. |
| Lgals3 | Microglia | Activated/DAM (Galectin‑3⁺) | Upregulated | Galectin‑3 drives phagocytosis and TREM2 signaling; strong DAM/plaqued‑associated marker. |

Most markers map to disease-associated microglia (DAM), including a prominent Spp1⁺/osteoclast‑like module (Spp1, Atp6v0d2, Gpnmb, Fabp5, Dkk2, Itgax, Cst7, Lgals3) and an antigen-presenting MHC‑II arm (H2-Aa/H2-Ab1/H2-Eb1, Cd74). Homeostatic signatures (P2ry12, Siglech) are down, consistent with an activated, plaque‑proximal state. Additional genes (Plau, Trpc4, Ctnna3, Mamdc2) support activation/motility and ECM remodeling, while Igf1 suggests a concurrent reparative program. Overall, cluster 3 reflects plaque‑associated, antigen‑presenting Spp1⁺ DAM with suppressed homeostatic identity.

| Ifitm10 | Microglia | Stress-adaptive | Upregulated | IFITM family member; up in stress/injury contexts, potential role in membrane remodeling. |

Cluster 4 shows a mixed profile: upregulation of signaling, motility, and immune-modulating genes (Cacnb2, Bank1, Ccr5, Rapgef5, Maf) with concurrent preservation of homeostatic identity (Tmem119↑) and marked downregulation of DAM/phagolysosomal machinery (Trem2, Tyrobp, Cd68, Ctsb, Ctsz, Lyz2). This suggests a non-DAM reactive state biased toward chemotaxis and cytoskeletal remodeling rather than debris clearance. The pattern could reflect microglia mobilized for migration or vascular surveillance, rather than plaque-engulfment, potentially relevant to vascular and inflammatory components of ARIA where microglial motility and cytokine signaling are heightened while phagocytosis is reduced.

Cluster 5 exhibits a marked downregulation of complement components (C1qa/b/c) and multiple lysosomal/phagocytic markers (Itgam, Ctss, Hexb, Laptm5), indicating a suppressed DAM-like phagocytic program. Concurrently, upregulated genes point to a mixed interferon-responsive and inflammatory signaling state (Ifi207, Ccl4, Ly86, Klf6, Atf3) with regulatory feedback mechanisms (Dusp1, Lilrb4a) and ECM remodeling (Xylt1). Loss of homeostatic markers (P2ry12, Marcks, Rgs10, Cst3) reinforces a non-homeostatic activated phenotype, biased toward cytokine production and immune modulation rather than debris clearance.

Cluster 6 shows uniform upregulation of type I interferon–stimulated genes (ISGs), including antiviral effectors (Ifit3, Rsad2, Mx1, Ifitm3), nucleic acid sensors (Oasl2, Stat1, Sp100), and ISGylation machinery (Isg15, Herc6). This profile is characteristic of interferon-responsive microglia (IRMs), a distinct activation state often triggered by viral infection, nucleic acid release from damaged cells, or chronic inflammatory cues. The absence of downregulated homeostatic or phagocytic genes suggests a strong, focused IRM polarization rather than mixed activation with DAM or AIM features.

Across clusters, we observe classic Spp1⁺ DAM/ARM features (cluster 3), a robust IFN‑I IRM state (cluster 6), and multiple reactive, non‑DAM states (clusters 0, 2, 4, 5) differing by IEG/NF‑κB intensity, chemotaxis/motility bias, and complement/lysosome suppression. One cluster trends toward resolution/quiescence (cluster 1). Together, these assignments align with established microglial taxonomies distinguishing homeostatic, reactive (AIM/ARM), DAM/MGnD, and IRM states in mouse models of neurodegeneration and inflammation.
