## UMAPs

### All cell types

Comparison of UMAPs previously annotated using ScType and clustered with Seurat.

```{r}
#| column: page
#| fig-width: 12
Idents(alldata) <- alldata@meta.data$sctype_classification
d1 <- DimPlot(alldata, label = TRUE, repel = T) + 
    NoLegend() + ggtitle("ScType annotated")

Idents(alldata) <- alldata@meta.data$seurat_clusters
d2 <- DimPlot(alldata, label = TRUE, repel = T) + 
    NoLegend() + ggtitle("Seurat clusters")

d1|d2
```

### Only microglia

```{r}
#| column: page
#| fig-width: 12

microglia <- subset(alldata, subset = sctype_classification =="Microglial cells", idents = alldata$seurat_clusters)
# save(microglia, file = "data/20250809-microglia1.Rdata")
d3 <- DimPlot(microglia, label = TRUE, repel = T, label.size = 6) + 
    NoLegend() + ggtitle("Only microglial cells")

d4 <- FeaturePlot(microglia, features = c("ribo_percent"))

d3|d4
```

Ribosomal Content Varies Across Microglial Subclusters. However, when examining the top marker genes obtained from FindAllMarkers, there are no ribosomal genes among the most discriminative features (_except in cluster 17_). This suggests that while ribosomal content varies, it does not directly drive cluster identity at the transcriptional marker level.


### Clusters according to treatments (Adu vs. IgG)

__All those cluster appear in both treatment groups__:

```{r}
#| column: page
#| fig-width: 12
DimPlot(microglia, label = TRUE, repel = T, split.by = "type", label.size = 6) + 
    NoLegend() 
```

```{r}
cell <- microglia@meta.data |> 
    group_by(type, seurat_clusters) |> 
    summarize (n=n()) |> 
    pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = n) |> 
    mutate(Adu_percent = round(Adu/sum(Adu)*100,1),
           IgG_percent = round(IgG/sum(IgG)*100,1))

kbl (cell, caption = "Cells per cluster",
     col.names =c("Cluster",rep(c("Adu","IgG"),2))) |> 
    kable_styling("striped") |> 
    add_header_above(c(" ","cells (n)"=2,"cells (%)" =2), bold = T)
```


##  Microglial subpopulations. Cluster-specific markers.

The `FindMarkers` function was applied to the complete dataset, analyzing all available cells without any subsetting. By not subsetting prior to marker detection, the analysis maximizes statistical power.

This set is dominated by **vascular-associated cells** — mostly **endothelial cells** and **mural cells** (pericytes, vascular smooth muscle cells) — with a few neuronal genes (*Il34, Lin7a, Ctdspl*), one perivascular macrophage gene (*Morrbid*), and a dual-identity pericyte/OPC marker (*Cspg4*). The strong enrichment for *Ndufa4l2, P2ry14, Kcnj8, Myl9* points to **capillary/perivascular structures**, often at the brain–blood barrier.

This list is overwhelmingly **T-cell–specific**, with strong enrichment for **CD3-complex genes** (*Cd3e, Cd3g, Trac*), **TCR signaling molecules** (*Itk, Lck, Themis, Grap2*), and **effector/memory T cell markers** (*Cxcr6, Runx3, Cd226, Stat4*). These signatures correspond to **brain-infiltrating T lymphocytes**, especially **CD8⁺ cytotoxic** and **tissue-resident memory (TRM)** subsets, with a possible small contribution from NK cells.

One gene (*Atp8b4*) is clearly a **microglia marker**, suggesting either minor contamination or genuine presence of myeloid cells in this population. *Ptprc* confirms leukocyte origin.

| **Mpeg1** | Microglia / Macrophage | BAMs and activated microglia | Perforin-like protein; high in phagocytic myeloid cells. |

This list is dominated by **microglia**, with a strong **homeostatic core signature** (*C1qa, C1qb, C1qc, Hexb*) combined with **activation/DAM markers** (*Trem2, Tyrobp, Fcer1g, Grn, Mpeg1*). This suggests you are seeing a **mixed microglial population** — mostly homeostatic, with a substantial activated/DAM subset.

A few genes are neuronal (*Syngr1, Cox6a2*) or ubiquitous ribosomal (*Fau, Rplp1*), which could represent low-level neuronal contamination or ambient RNA.

This is a **Type I interferon–driven microglial/macrophage activation signature** with strong antiviral and inflammatory chemokine components. Key canonical ISGs (*Ifit3, Mx1, Rsad2, Oasl2, Cxcl10*) are all upregulated in **microglia** during viral infection models, neuroinflammation, or interferonopathies.

A few genes (*Pik3ap1, Lyn*) have higher expression in **B cells**, so there might be a minor infiltrating B-lymphocyte component, but the dominant source here is clearly **microglia** in an **interferon-activated state**.

classic **inflammatory myeloid signature**, enriched for NF-κB–driven cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules. This cluster is dominated by **pro-inflammatory, NF-κB–activated microglia/macrophages**, with hallmarks of **antigen presentation** (*Cd86, Tnfsf9*), **inflammasome activation** (*Nlrp3, Il1b*), and **NF-κB–driven cytokines** (*Tnf, Osm*). The **Mir155hg / Bcl2a1b/d** combination is typical of strong inflammatory activation.

The presence of *Pdgfb* suggests possible **cross-talk to the vascular compartment**, which is often seen in perivascular macrophages or activated microglia near blood vessels.

**anti-inflammatory / resolution-phase myeloid signature**. This cluster fits an **activated but immunoregulatory / repair-oriented microglia–macrophage phenotype**, sometimes called **M2-like** or **resolution-phase** microglia.  

Key features:

* **Anti-inflammatory feedback**: *Tnfaip3, Dusp6, Ppp1r15a*.
* **Phagocytosis and repair**: *Mertk, Tgm2*.
* **Neuroimmune signaling**: *Adrb2* (responds to adrenergic input).
* **Metabolic shift**: *Agmo, Pde3b, Abcd2, Tbxas1*.

Compared to cluster 0 (high *Tnf, Il1b, Nlrp3*), this is a **less inflammatory, more resolution-oriented state**,  possibly spatially closer to degenerating neurons or vasculature undergoing repair.

**Hypoxia- and lysosome-enriched myeloid state**, possibly linked to **perivascular or hypoxic microglia/macrophages**. Cluster 2 has a strong **lysosomal–phagocytic core** (*Ctsd, Ctss, Ctsz, Rab7b, Hexb*), combined with **hypoxia/metabolic adaptation** genes (*Hif1a, Egln3, Pfkfb3, P4ha1*). This is typical of **microglia or perivascular macrophages in hypoxic environments** (e.g., around ischemic lesions or tightly packed tumor vasculature).

The presence of *Serpine2* and *P4ha1* suggests **ECM remodeling and perivascular interaction**, while *Fcgr3* and *Tagap* keep the profile immune-competent.

The anchor gene here is **P2ry12**, marking this as a **homeostatic microglia cluster**, likely representing surveillant microglia in healthy or less perturbed brain regions.

Supporting markers for microglial identity:

* *Tgfbr1* → required for microglial homeostasis.
* *Siglech*, *Dock8*, *Ltc4s* → immune cell motility/communication genes.

The presence of multiple **neuronal genes** (*Atp8a2, Ophn1, Csmd3, Srgap2*) is probably due to **phagocytosis of neuronal debris** or ambient RNA contamination, which is common in microglial clusters.

Clusters key microglia markers are **Gpr34** and **C3ar1**, both associated with **homeostatic or early-activated microglia**. Several genes (*Nrp1, Apbb1ip, Arhgap24, Fyb, Marchf3*) point to **motility and immune synapse formation**, suggesting a migratory/interactive state.

However, there’s substantial **neuronal RNA background** (*Cacna1a, Tanc2, Sdk1, Nav2, Fgf13*), which could be due to microglia physically interacting with neurons or to ambient RNA contamination in single-cell prep.

Compared to the “resting-like” cluster (4, *P2ry12*⁺), this one:

* Shares homeostatic markers but
* Shows more **motility-related genes** and complement receptor *C3ar1* (engaged in surveillance or early response).

#### Cluster 27

```{r}

This cluster seems a **proliferating / cell-cycle microglia** cluster, with strong mitotic spindle and chromosome segregation gene expression.

**Cell-cycle cluster**, almost certainly representing **dividing microglia/macrophages** in the dataset. These cells express:

* **Core mitotic machinery** (*Mki67, Top2a, Birc5, Cenpe/f, Tpx2, Nusap1*).
* **DNA replication enzymes** (*Rrm2, H3c3*).
* **Cytokinesis regulators** (*Prc1, Aspm*).

These are likely **microglia proliferating in response to injury or inflammation**, possibly bridging from homeostatic/early activation states into DAM or antigen-presenting states.
